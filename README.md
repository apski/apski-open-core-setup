there's a git repo that should show all the changes. didn't run from the start which i should have done.

28/Sept/2021

so i don't really remember what you did to get the stuff working.

i remember there was a usb drive that had a lot of the stuff.

and that you used the `./MountEFI.command` to mount the drive and change things there. or double-click on MountEFI.command
